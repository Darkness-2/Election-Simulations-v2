# Election Simulations v2

### Objective
To explore 'what if' scenarios for what Canada's elections might look like under different electoral systems. The goal is not only to examine what the results would be under these systems, but also to consider the parameters and pros/cons of each system.

### List of Simulations
- First-past-the-post (FPTP) (Canada's existing system)
- Mixed-member-proportional (MMP) (New Zealand)
